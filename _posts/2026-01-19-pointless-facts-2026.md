One easy method of stepping around the writer's block is to use the prompts provided by blogging challenges. They make for an easy and lightweight starting point. [Here is one](https://abhinavsarkar.net/notes/2025-ten-pointless-facts/) that was doing the rounds last year.

## 1. Do you floss your teeth?

Nope, never have. Flossing isn't as big a deal in India as it is generally in the west. I haven't found a need to floss, but I do brush my teeth thoroughly twice a day.

## 2. Tea, coffee, or water?

This is complicated. Water is my favorite beverage, but I like to have a cup of cold/warm milk (depending on the season) with my breakfast. Even when going out, rather than going for coffee or tea, I generally prefer a drink with milk as the primary ingredient. My wife is a huge tea lover, so since my marriage I have been getting more and more comfortable with tea also.

## 3. Footwear preference?

These shoes from the ["Bata – Power"](https://www.bata.com/in/power-outdoor-shoes-for-men-500_0PW8338944503F.html) brand are what I find the most comfortable. In summers they only get worn outdoors, but winters see a separate pair come out specifically to be worn indoors.

## 4. Favourite dessert?

If we are talking about cold dessert, then generally some flavour of ice-cream, I tend to enjoy a variety of different flavours.

If we are talking about warm dessert, then walnut brownies are the ones who take the crown.

## 5. The first thing you do when you wake up?

Drink a lot of water. I generally tend to not wake up in the middle of the night, and as a result am generally parched by the time morning comes around.

## 6. Age you'd like to stick at?

On the one hand, I am fine with my current age. But if I could keep accruing the wisdom and experience, then I would like to keep my fitness levels from back when I was 22–23 years old.

## 7. How many hats do you own?

None. Caps are the preferred mode of sun-protection in India. I have four caps and three beanies. I don't think I have bought any of those, my dad generally gets me cool caps and beanies that he finds. Thanks dad ❤️

## 8. Describe the last photo you took?

It is of a makeshift cloth-tent that me and my wife made in our balcony to protect the _papdis_ that we put out for drying.

## 9. Worst TV show?

No idea. If I find a show bad, then I generally don't tend to watch it any further. So I can't rank any of them as being the "worst".

## 10. As a child, what was your aspiration for adulthood?

There were different phases, including being an archeologist, being a soldier, a sports-person, etc. But the one that remained the longest was being a rocket-scientist. My parents (love you both ❤️) even got me a nice poster built of famous astronauts and rocket scientists to hang by my bedside.

This challenge was initiated by David over at [Forking Mad](https://forkingmad.blog/ten-pointless-facts-about-me/). I found it from one of [Abhinav's posts](https://abhinavsarkar.net/notes/2025-ten-pointless-facts/) last year.
