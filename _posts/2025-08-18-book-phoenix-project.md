>
> The company's new IT initiative, code named Phoenix Project, is critical to the future of Parts Unlimited, but the project is massively over budget and very late. The CEO wants Bill to report directly to him and fix the mess in ninety days or else Bill's entire department will be outsourced.

While there are a lot of clichÃ© tropes, I still highly recommend this book to every IT professional as it is the only (along with [The Unicorn Project]()) story/novel written about out profession.

It helps a lot to learn about "The Three Ways" and to try and incorporate them into our daily lives whether we are a developer or an ops person or someone else along the chain of software production. You will also be able to spot yourself and quite a few of your colleagues in the characters in here.
