This will be a really short post. I went to a nearby book store this week and bought _a few_ of books.

- Smarter Faster Better - Charles Duhigg

## The Challenge

The challenge I have taken is to read all of these books before the end of this year. This is a stretch goal for me (even considering that I have read the Sherlock stories already) taking into account that I probably haven't read 8 books during this whole year till now.

I am excited to see how far I can take this. Will post updates in the coming weeks here, wish me luck ✌️.

Want to wish me luck for this challenge or have anything else to discuss, then please get in touch via [email](mailto:contact@varunbarad.com) or over at Twitter on [@varun_barad](https://twitter.com/varun_barad).
