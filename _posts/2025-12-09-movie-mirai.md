Score: 2/5 🤷️

> Following the historic Kalinga battle, where King Ashoka of the Maurya dynasty emerged as the winner, he chose to walk the path of peace instead of continuing warfare.

This did not live up to its hype. They have an extremely solid concept to grow their story from, but nearly everything after that doesn't hold up to the potential. Good to see that we are finally starting to base movies off our cultural history.

Character writing, script writing, performance of many actors, accuracy in animations and a lot many other things just failed spectacularly. But for some reason I didn't feel that I wasted my time and would have been better off not watching this movie at all.

The concept and overall story were so good that I think a game like old-school Prince of Persia could be made from it.
