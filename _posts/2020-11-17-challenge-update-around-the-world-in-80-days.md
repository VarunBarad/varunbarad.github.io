So I finished my first book for the challenge last night. Around the World in 80 Days was definitely a fun read as the story progressed. I couldn't enjoy it properly from the start because I was constantly comparing it both to the movie and to other suspense adventure stories (but there was no suspense in a way here as I knew that they do end up completing the journey in time).

One thing I have taken from this 2 weeks' experience is that I am cutting my book numbers for the challenge by half. Otherwise it would just be unnecessarily stressful to juggle this challenge along with all other responsibilities.

So now I only intend to finish these 4 books before the year ends:

- Around the World in 80 Days (Already completed)
- Smarter Faster Better (Somewhere between 15-20% progress in this one)
- The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
- A Caribbean Mystery

Will keep you folks posted on how things progress from here. Bye for now ðŸ‘‹
