Today I finished the second book for my end of year reading challenge. The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes was a book which I had read previously, but this was probably the first time I was reading it in paperback format. I could remember some stories from my previous reading and would observe the clues alongside Mr Holmes before he explained it to Dr Watson. Then there were others where I would be just as blind as my first read through of the story (in the past) and the bulb would only light up when Holmes gave an explanation as to how he reached to his deductions.

I still feel as if I am lagging behind in the challenge but there is always hope, and I do hope that I will be completing the remaining two books before the year ends. Or if not by then, then definitely on the first weekend of the new year.

My progress now looks like this:

- Around the World in 80 Days (Completed)
- The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Completed)
- Smarter Faster Better (Somewhere between 15-20% progress in this one)
- A Caribbean Mystery

Will keep you folks posted on how things progress from here. Bye for now ðŸ‘‹
