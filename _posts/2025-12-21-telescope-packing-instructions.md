I got my wife a telescope (["Celestron StarSense Explorer LT 80AZ"](https://www.celestron.com/products/starsense-explorer-lt-80az) is the specific model) on her birthday. It is an engineering marvel for what is a consumer product. The one downside for it is that everytime when packing it I had to think of where each part went, which things get covers where, and stuff like that. This time I wrote down a list of all the things and where they get packed.

1. Tripod
   1. Tripod thermocol spacer
2. Tripod eyepiece storage tray
3. Main Tube
4. Red Dot Sight (with a piece of railing attached)
5. 1 piece paper Star Dial
6. Manuals for telescope
7. StarSense phone dock
8. Triangular piece of sheet metal that is supposed to act as a screwdriver
9. Cover plug for eyepiece-hole in the main tube. Fitted in main-tube.
10. Desiccant Cap/Cup
11. Eyepiece lens - 25 mm
    1. Covers on both ends. Tube-side white, eye-side black.
    2. Stored in a plastic zip-lock bag.
12. Eyepiece lens - 10 mm
    1. No covers.
    2. Stored in a rubber-plastic bottle.
13. Barlow lens - 2x magnification
    1. Black plug/cover on both ends.
    2. Stored in a plastic zip-lock bag.
14. Right-angle eyepiece mirror attachment
    1. Covers on both ends. Tube-side white cover, eyepiece side black plug. 
15. Zip-lock bag containing: [4] and [14]
16. 2 screw knobs to attach main-tube to tripod.
17. Cleaning liquid bottle
18. Cleaning cloth
19. Zip-lock bag containing: [16], [17] and [18]
20. A different cleaning cloth
21. Grey cloth bag containing: [8], [10], [11], [12], [13], [15], [19], [20]
22. Small cardboard box which goes besides tripod box. Contains [2] and [21]
23. Tripod goes in small bubble-wrap bag
24. Tripod cardboard box which contains [7] and [23]
25. Thermocol spacer/stabilizer for main-tube mounting rod
26. Main-tube goes in a regular plastic bag and then gets wrapped in large/thick bubble wrap sheet
27. Main-tube cardboard box
28. Main Celestron box containing [5], [6], [22], [24], [27]
29. Transport outer cardboard box which only contains [28]

Let's hope this helps the next time I have to pack the scope after a session.
