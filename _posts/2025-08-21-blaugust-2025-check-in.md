We are around two-thirds of the way through August. So how are you doing? How is your initial target holding? How are you holding mentally?

## How am I holding up on paper?

My original target was the Rainbow Diamond badge, which demands at least 31 posts. Counting today's post, I should have been at 21 posts to keep up with that target. But so far I am at 18 posts (including this one), which is three posts behind schedule.

Out of the remaining 13 posts, I have topics for 8 posts. And it is these five unknown topics that scare me more than those three backlog posts.

## How am I holding mentally?

It is way tougher than I thought it would be. And I had thought that it would be tough. While I did finish the two books that were on my currently reading list, I have not picked up any new ones. Nor have I been able to play any video games. That is because I am putting all my after-work available bandwidth into this.

But this has also shown me a side of mine I didn't know until yet. I never thought I would be able to publish four blog posts within 24 hours, which I did this last Sunday. It helped break the barrier for a lot of different kinds of posts to come to my blog: recipes, media recommendations, and travel diaries (to name a few).

That is how I am doing with Blaugust. How are you all? For me the target is still the Rainbow Diamond badge. So, onwards and upwards I go.
