One of the community group-post topic in this year's Blaugust was "Low Stakes Hot Takes". Basically something which is rather inconsequential but which you feel very strongly about. I will start with one here and later on keep adding more if I feel so.

## Red key-switches are better than Brown key-switches

In mechanical keyboards I believe that linear red switches are objectively better than tactile brown switches. The linear motion, compared to the tactile bump, feels lighter on fingers, thus reducing the chances of RSI. It also generally helps that they are quieter compared to the others.
