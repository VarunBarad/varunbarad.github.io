There are 2 ways to provide username and password when downloading files using wget

## Directly as parameters

```shell
wget --user "<username-goes-here>" --password "<password-goes-here>" "<file-url-goes-here>"
```

This has the disadvantage that it will show up in your shell history and in running processes lists, thus exposing your password.

## Interactively entering the password

Another way is to tell wget to interactively ask you for the password

```shell
wget --user "<username-goes-here>" --ask-password "<file-url-goes-here>"
```

Here instead of the password showing up in your command, wget asks you to enter your password.
