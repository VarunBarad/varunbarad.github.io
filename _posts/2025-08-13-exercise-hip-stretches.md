I follow basically these two videos from ["Yoga & You"](https://www.youtube.com/@VentunoYoga):

- [Hip Opening Sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdZtA5v2H2U) (I start with this and complete it)
- [Hip Opening Sequence - 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssLxr0weI7Y) (I only do the first exercise from this)

These are the exercise steps written out, but do check out the videos as the visual representation helps:

1. Baddha Konasana (Butterfly Pose)
    - Sit with your heels close to the groin, soles of your feet should touch each other
    - Bend forward as deep as you can go, using a block as support under your forehead if required
2. Supta Baddha Konasana
    - Lie down on your back and bring the soles of your feet together, bringing the heels as close to the groin as possible
    - Drop the knees down as much as you can without pain, use blocks as support if necessary
3. Anand Balasana (Happy Baby Pose)
   - While lying down, raise your feet above you and try to bring the knees towards the chest
   - Hold the arches of your feet from the inside and slowly let your knees drop more and more to the floor with each exhalation
   - Ensure that your entire back is lying flat and supported
4. Knee-to-Chest and then Drop-to-Side
   - Lying on your back, hug your right knee into the chest
   - Use your right palm to gently drop the right knee to your right side while keeping the left hip pressed into the ground
   - Keep it there for a few breaths, inhale while bringing it back to your chest
   - Now use your left palm to guide the right knee over you and towards the ground on the left side of your body. Outstretch your right arm to your right side and ensure the right shoulder blade remains grounded. This should put a gentle twist in your spine.
   - Mirror the same with the other leg
5. Figure Four (4) Stretch
   - Lie on your back with both feet hip-width apart.
   - Place your right ankle on the left thigh with the right knee opened out.
   - Lift the left leg and thread your arms around the left leg to hug it closer to your chest
   - Mirror the same with the other leg
