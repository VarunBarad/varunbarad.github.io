![Bronze, Silver, Gold and Amethyst badges for "Wordsmith" achievements](../assets/images/posts/blogging-achievements/wordsmith.webp)

I got an in-game achievement when playing a game recently - a small pop-up, a flashy badge, and that familiar burst of satisfaction. Last week when writing for Blaugust it struck my mind that we can make something similar for our own blogs.

A personal blog doesn't have to be just some posts on a page - it can be a game in itself, with milestones and badges for them milestones. That tiny bit of gamification can turn routine writing and site maintenance into a playful (yet capturing) quest.

I came up with some ideas along those lines, some are one-off while some have tiers to them. I have even designed progression badges for one of them.
