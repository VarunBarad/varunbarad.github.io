And that's a wrap. At the start of this month I set my sights on the Rainbow Diamond badge, which demanded I write 31 or more posts in this month. This is the 31<sup>st</sup> post, the final one.

It was punishing as hell. My wife put it best, she said, "Since school times, you haven't liked doing a single day's homework. And you thought you would be happy signing up for 31 days of homework?"

I have always been a person who doesn't like the process of writing, but I like having written. These past 31 days have been similar. I ended up putting a lot of things I love doing on the back-burner. I did not read books, I did not play video games, I did not watch any movies, I did not work on any side-project code.

All of my available free time was going towards Blaugust, even when my brain would have been much happier to do something else. It made me miserable, I don't like being miserable. But this Blaugust was a test of discipline for me, and I was not prepared to lose.

Neither was I prepared enough to win ðŸ˜…. I believe that a hard-fought victory is not really a victory, it is at best not-a-defeat. Okay, I have got all the rant out of me, now on to the good parts.

Did I enjoy it? A heck of a lot. No doubt about that. The community was really nice and I found quite a few other blogs which I enjoyed reading. This month was finally the time when I felt that someone other than me also reads my blog.

Having to write ~~daily~~ regularly also helped me expand into other domains that I wanted to for quite some time. A bunch of old drafts and ideas also got dusted off and turned into full posts. It also taught me that if I just have a topic then I can turn that into a blog post if I just sit and start typing. I don't need to wait for an inspiration or to feel the right time or anything of that sort.

Would I participate again next year? Definitely. I will be participating each year that I can, but I won't be setting the same target for myself. It was a one-time experiment for me, and I am happy that I did it. Blaugust is great, and now I understand why first timers are not suggested to target the Rainbow Diamond badge.

There were a lot of times when I missed the day's post, but weekends were my friend, they helped me bounce back every single time. Here's a graph of what the standard rate of posting required me to publish and how I actually ended up publishing.
