## Introduction

The Apgar score is a method to quickly summarize the health of newborn children against infant mortality. Virginia Apgar, an anesthesiologist at NewYorkâ€“Presbyterian Hospital, developed the score in 1952 to quantify the effects of obstetric anesthesia on babies.

The Apgar score is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on 5 simple criteria, each on a scale of zero to two. Then summing up the five values thus obtained gives a final Apgar score on the scale of zero to ten.

The five criteria are summarized using words with APGAR as acronym:
1. Appearance
2. Pulse
3. Grimace
4. Activity
5. Respiratory effort

## Criteria

|                               | Score of 0                 | Score of 1                                   | Score of 2                     |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Appearance (Skin Color)       | Blue or pale all over      | Blue at extremities; Body pink               | Completely pink                |
| Pulse (Heart-beat)            | Absent                     | Less than 100 beats per minute               | More than 100 beats per minute |
| Grimace (Reflex irritability) | No response to stimulation | Grimace on suction or aggressive stimulation | Cry on stimulation             |
| Activity                      | None                       | Flexed arms and legs                         | Active movement                |
| Respiratory effort            | Absent                     | Weak, irregular gasping                      | Strong robust cry              |

## Interpretation of scores

The test is generally done at 1 and 5 minutes after birth and may be repeated later if the score is and remains low.

- 7 and above are generally normal
- 4 to 6 are considered fairly low
- 3 or below are regarded as critically low and imply need of immediate resuscitative efforts

Apgar test's purpose is to quickly determine whether or not a newborn needs immediate medical care.
