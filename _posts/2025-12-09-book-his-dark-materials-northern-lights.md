> Lyra Belacqua and her animal daemon live half-wild and carefree among scholars of Jordan College, Oxford. The destiny that awaits her will take her to the frozen lands of the Arctic, where witch-clans reign and ice-bears fight. Her extraordinary journey will have immeasurable consequences far beyond her own world.

The story was extremely slow in the starting and took a long time to pick up its pace, but it did become a page-turner somewhere around the half-way mark. I did find it interesting for a few chapters, but I again started losing interest when we got to know what the gobblers are doing and why they are doing it. The thing is, in this book's world there aren't many people doing/being good, but the flip-side both has a lot of candidates and the magnitudes of their evils are beyond any sane limits.

I do have the other two books in this series, but as of now I am unsure whether I will read them.
