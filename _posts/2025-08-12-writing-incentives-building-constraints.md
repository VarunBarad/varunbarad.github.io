When you like building things and also want to write about them, but you have a bias toward building over writing, the writing-about-it part doesn’t happen very often. A solution I’ve found is to not move from one project to the next until I’ve written about the one I just finished (getting it to a good-enough point counts as finished).

When I made [valet](./project-valet), I ended up writing four different posts about that project—only because I didn’t allow myself to start the next one before finishing all the writing I had related to valet.

This approach can also help ensure our blogs don’t become the kind where the only posts are about setting up the blog/platform and upgrading it. The rule here: write and publish an article before you’re allowed to add any new feature to the site. Want to add a "now" page? Then first write a post about “your thoughts on comments in blogs” (or anything you want to write about) before adding that page.

I read about this concept on someone’s blog, but I can’t remember whose. I’ll update with the link if I find it.
