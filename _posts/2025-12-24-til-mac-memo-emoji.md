Recently when writing another one of my TIL entries, I got curious whether the 📝 emoji on mac contains actual text or is it just some scribbles.

Turns out, it does contain actual text, and that too from the famous poem "Here's to the crazy ones". I first heard that poem at the end of the [Jobs movie](https://www.thetvdb.com/movies/jobs).

Now when I was researching for this article, I found out that it was originally part of Apple's "Think Different" ad campaign back in the day (source: [Basic Apple Guy](https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/heres-to-the-crazy-ones)). And it turns out the same poem shows up in multiple emojis and at many other places throughout the whole system.

While I am not generally a fan of Apple and its recent design decisions of the past few years, I don't expect this level of nice design from any other major tech company.

**:chefs_kiss:** (I wish unicode had this emoji)
