> Far out in the Arabian Sea, where the waters plunge many thousands of metres to the ocean floor, lies a chain of bewitching coral atolls–the Lakshadweep Islands. Vikram and Aditya dive into lagoons with crystal-clear water and reefs that are deep and shrouded in mystery. But when they stumble upon a devious kidnapping plot, their idyllic holiday turns into a desperate struggle for survival.

It has been a long time since I read a teenage adventure story, and this was a refreshing change of pace. I picked this up to read during flights on a recent trip, and I am happy to have finished it on the flight back.

While I don't know the first thing of captaining a boat, the descriptions of that and the coral lagoon felt immersive. A good amount of tension builds up, but the author luckily doesn't drag it on without any purpose.

After Aditya's encounter with the radio, I am going to go and memorise the international frequencies for transmitting SOS signals.
