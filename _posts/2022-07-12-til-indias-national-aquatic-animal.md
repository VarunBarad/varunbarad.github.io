Today (well actually this past Sunday) I learned that nations also have something known as their "National Aquatic Animal" (NAA).

I was visiting the [aquatic gallery](https://sciencecity.gujarat.gov.in/ticketing/ticket/aquatic-gallery-41) (a recent addition) of [Science City](https://sciencecity.gujarat.gov.in/home) near me and found out that besides just plain old dolphins that we hear/see about there is also something called River Dolphins and that India's National Aquatic Animal is actually a __River Dolphin__.

Later looking up on Wikipedia I found that it is specifically the [Ganges (Platanista gangetica)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges_river_dolphin) variant that is India's NAA.

PS: If you are in Gujarat, India then you should definitely take out a day and visit the Science City in Ahmedabad ([Google Maps link](https://goo.gl/maps/kHXJnbhLNF2D8z557)).
