**Context:** Any file appearing to be stored in `SourceDirectory` are actually stored in `DestinationDirectory`.

To create a link from `SourceDirectory` to `DestinationDirectory`

```batch
mklink /3 "<full-path-to-SourceDirectory>" "<full-path-to-DestinationDirectory>"
```

Have a great day people ðŸ‘‹
