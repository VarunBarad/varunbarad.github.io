```

## Use single-quote inside a string

Put two single-quotes (') wherever you want to use a single-quote inside the string

```sql
select * from people where full_name = 'Travis O''Connor'
```

## Convert timestamptz to a timestamp in a particular timezone

Assuming `created_at` is a column in table `people` with type `timstamptz` and we want to see what those timestamps are in IST (Asia/Kolkata or Asia/Calcutta)

```sql
select created_at at time zone 'Asia/Kolkata' as shifted from people
```
