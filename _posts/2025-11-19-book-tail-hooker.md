The book is quite a roller-coaster ride through the author's life journey in becoming a fighter pilot in the Indian Navy. It is nicely broken up into bite-sized chapters. There was not a single dull/boring chapter, and many were outright hilarious.

Somewhere in the foreword or preface it was mentioned that the author has woven both real stories and some fictional incidents nicely together. On reading a few chapters I strongly felt that they mentioned some being fiction just so they can say that no such thing actually happens in the Navy.

Regardless of it being fact or fiction, had a great time reading it.

**PS:** Also, since this book was not already in the [OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org) database, I also got a chance to add this there.
