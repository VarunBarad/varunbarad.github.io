I came across this concept the other day called "Ugh Fields". Basically it points out that there are some/many areas in your life/work which you always flinch away from, they don't start out that bad but eventually pavlovian conditioning almost turns them into areas that we can't go into.

This is one of the few pieces of writing that I consider a must-read for everyone.
