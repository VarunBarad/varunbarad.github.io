In a year of nice films (Chhaava and Kesari 2 come to mind), this three and half-hour banger stood out like a beacon. When I originally heard its songs, none other than the [title track](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=WzoSWtDDo1M) and [Ishq Jalakar - Karvaan](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=_dV23pgH3Ng) seemed good. But man have they integrated it well into the movie, now I like all of them as hearing any of them transports me to the movie part of it.

The star-casting, the story writing, the performance (of each individual actor), I can't decide which of them was the best. All of them are so well done that the end-product is simply spectacular. Everyone did an awesome job, but my personal favorite was [Rakesh Bedi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakesh_Bedi) as "Jameel Jamali".

I am so happy I got to see this in theatres and can't wait to rewatch it once it is available on television. Eagerly waiting for the sequel coming in March next year (current year by the time you read this).
