I learned this card game back in my college days. It is a team-based 4-player game played with a standard deck of cards. Players sitting opposite are in the same team and the goal is to capture as many Tens as you can.

## Setup

- 4 players: Two teams of two, partners sit opposite
- Standard 52 card deck
- Dealer is chosen randomly for the first game, then rotates clockwise
- The person sitting to the left of dealer decides the trump suit after getting their first 5 cards and 
- The aim is to capture as many of the four Tens as possible. Each Ten counts as one point, no other card counts for any points.

## Gameplay

- The dealer distributes 5 cards to each player
- The person to the left of dealer selects the trump suit after seeing their 5 cards
- Then the dealer distributes the remaining cards (8 to each player)
- The person who decided the trump suit starts the first trick
- Players must follow the suit if possible, if not they may play any card
- The highest card of the led suit wins the trick, but if the trump suit has also been played then the highest card of trump suit wins
- The winner of the trick starts the next one

## Scoring

- Scores are calculated for teams, and not individuals.
- Each captured Ten counts for 1 point
- No other card capture counts towards points
- Four games together make up a session
