title: "Random Book Box"
---

Recently I have seen a lot of online booksellers here offer something along the lines of a "Random Book Box" in which they would select `x` number of random books from their inventory and package it for you.

Those are the parts I like about the idea but what I don't like is that generally these are sellers of used books and their inventory consists mostly of titles that I've never heard before and that I won't actually care about reading.

My idea is basically to build something to which I can tell about what books I want to read and what books some of my friends suggest, then it can build me a box out of those which then a friend can order for me. Similarly, I can be one of the friends who makes such a random book box for one of my friends.
