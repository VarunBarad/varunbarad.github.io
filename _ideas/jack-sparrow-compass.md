title: "Jack Sparrow's Compass"
---

The idea is to have a servo-motor driven compass which points us to the destination that we have selected in the companion app. It doesn't point us to which route we should take but just generally which direction our destination is in. First version can be just an Android app showing a compass needle pointing towards our destination.
