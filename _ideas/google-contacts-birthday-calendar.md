title: "Google Contacts Birthday Calendar"
---

Note: Eventually I made it and now it is [live on the interwebs](https://contacts-calendar.varunbarad.com) (the server is on a free tier so give it a few mins to load).

Google Contacts does have the birthdays of many people in your circles, but it doesn't expose those birthdays as a calendar feed which can be consumed from other calendar applications. So this will connect with Google Contacts and expose an iCal feed that you can subscribe to from any calendar application of your choice.
