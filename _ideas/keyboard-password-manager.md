title: "Keyboard with integrated password manager"
---

Many websites (such as banking) don't allow you to copy-paste your passwords. It would be awesome to have a keyboard which can send out HID signals for your password so that it appears as if you are typing the password instead of copy-pasting. Perfect bypass for every such shitty detection algorithms.
