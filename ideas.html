        I have realized that there are a lot more ideas (for things to do or make) in my head than I can remember or hope to execute upon.
        So this is just a holding pen for now of all the ideas that I can someday build upon. I would be glad if you like something from this
        and decide to build it yourself. Do let me know if you do so, it would be fun to discuss these with someone else ðŸ™‚

    <h3>Random Book Box</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Recently I have seen a lot of online booksellers here offer something along the lines of a "Random Book Box" in
            which they would select <code>x</code> number of random books from their inventory and package it for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those are the parts I like about the idea but what I don't like is that generally these are sellers of used
            books and their inventory consists mostly of titles that I've never heard before and that I won't actually
            care about reading.
        </p>
        <p>
            My idea is basically to build something to which I can tell about what books I want to read and what books
            some of my friends suggest, then it can build me a box out of those which then a friend can order for me.
            Similarly I can be one of the friends who makes such a random book box for one of my friends.
