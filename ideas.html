        I have realized that there are a lot more ideas (for things to do or make) in my head than I can remember or hope to execute upon.
        So this is just a holding pen for now of all the ideas that I can someday build upon. I would be glad if you like something from this
        and decide to build it yourself. Do let me know if you do so, it would be fun to discuss these with someone else ðŸ™‚

    <h3>Random Book Box</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Recently I have seen a lot of online booksellers here offer something along the lines of a "Random Book Box" in
            which they would select <code>x</code> number of random books from their inventory and package it for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those are the parts I like about the idea but what I don't like is that generally these are sellers of used
            books and their inventory consists mostly of titles that I've never heard before and that I won't actually
            care about reading.
        </p>
        <p>
            My idea is basically to build something to which I can tell about what books I want to read and what books
            some of my friends suggest, then it can build me a box out of those which then a friend can order for me.
            Similarly, I can be one of the friends who makes such a random book box for one of my friends.

    <h3>Google Contacts Birthday Calendar</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Google Contacts does have the birthdays of many people in your circles, but it doesn't expose those
            birthdays as a calendar feed which can be consumed from other calendar applications. So this will connect
            with Google Contacts and expose an iCal feed that you can subscribe to from any calendar application of your
            choice.

    <h3>Browser plugin to redirect YT Shorts to Regular YT Player</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            The video player used for YT Shorts doesn't have most of the playback controls like seek, volume, mute etc.
            But those videos can be played in the regular YT player by just replacing the url path.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shorts player URL scheme: <code>https://youtube.com/shorts/&lt;video-id&gt;</code>
            <br>
            Regular player URL scheme: <code>https://youtube.com/watch?v=&lt;video-id&gt;</code>

    <h3>Bathroom Emergency</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Install switches in bathrooms that when pressed would raise an alarm throughout the house. This is to
            indicate that someone needs help in one of the bathrooms. This becomes especially useful at nighttime
            because then people are in their own rooms and if someone hasn't got their phone in the bathroom when they
            fall, it would be extremely unlikely that it is noticed.
        </p>

        <p>
            These would ideally operate on more efficient hardware than an RPi because that would make deploying them
            and powering them with AA cells a much more achievable and long-lasting task.

    <h3>Jack Sparrow's Compass</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            The idea is to have a servo-motor driven compass which points us to the destination that we have selected in
            the companion app. It doesn't point us to which route we should take but just generally which direction our
            destination is in. First version can be just an Android app showing a compass needle pointing towards our
            destination.
