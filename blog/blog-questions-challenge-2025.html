                        <div class="post-content e-content"><p>This was a challenge/chain letter that went around near the beginning of this year. I wasn't tagged, but after reading <a href="https://localghost.dev/blog/the-blog-questions-challenge/">Sophie's post</a> yesterday, I accepted the tag from her.</p>
<h2>Why did you start blogging in the first place?</h2>
<p>I always wanted an online home I could point people to. By the time I reached college, Iâ€™d already seen the peak, fall, and sunset of Orkut. So I was sure it had to be a place under my control â€” a personal website.</p>
<p>Around the time I left college, I bought this domain and launched the first version of this site. Back then, it was mostly an online rÃ©sumÃ© with no blog or other functionalities.</p>
<p>As I read more blogs from professionals in my industry, I felt that I also should write similar stuff, like bugs that I encounter or some new concept that I learn. And that is how this blog was born.</p>
<h2>What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it? Have you blogged on other platforms before?</h2>
<p>The current version is built using <a href="https://11ty.dev">Eleventy</a>, a Node.js-based static site generator. I chose it because I wanted a build system that used JavaScript but didnâ€™t want to ship unnecessary JS to readers. Hosting is on <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a> these days.</p>
<p>Before that, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> was responsible for that duty, as it was supported out-of-the-box on GitHub Pages (where this blog used to be hosted). As I started to add more features, I found Jekyll's Ruby ecosystem unfamiliar and harder to work with.</p>
<p>And way back in the starting days, the site was just three files (one each of HTML, CSS, and JS) from a popular Bootstrap template. It was so common that within a week, I saw two other live sites using the exact same template ðŸ˜….</p>
<h2>How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that's part of your blog?</h2>
<p>All of my posts get created inside my IDE (I use WebStorm for this project). Most get written there too, but some I would open in <a href="https://typora.io/">Typora</a>, especially if it is prose-heavy. I once considered adding a writing/admin section to the blog, but it felt like too much overhead for too little benefit.</p>
<p>What I might start doing more frequently is to start a draft/post in <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> and then move it to the blog when it is ready. I also want to create scripts that would create the right file given the type of post I want to write and open it directly in Typora, so I don't necessarily need to open my IDE.</p>
<h2>When do you feel most inspired to write?</h2>
<p>Almost never. I like having written, but the starting inertia is always huge. In rare cases, I would have an idea/topic lodged in my head which demands to be written, and those are some of the easiest posts to write.</p>
<h2>Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?</h2>
<p>As soon as I complete writing (which might take multiple sessions), I move to fixing the grammar and structure, and maybe some light editing. After that it goes straight to be published without any further delays.</p>
<h2>What's your favourite post on your blog?</h2>
<p>It's like picking a favourite child, but I will play favourites. <a href="./filename-limits">&quot;ðŸ—‚ Filenames can't just be anything&quot;</a> was the most satisfying to write. Researching it was a real head-scratcher. I want people to know those details, but also hope they never need to.</p>
<h2>Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?</h2>
<p>Recently I've had plenty of ideas. Some I'll implement this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple changelog based on <a href="https://keepachangelog.com/">Keep a Changelog</a></li>
<li>A complete redesign, as neither my older theme (on post pages) nor my current theme (on other pages) are looking that good</li>
</ul>
<p>Some that might go into the next year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a <a href="https://nownownow.com">&quot;now&quot;</a> page with archives</li>
<li>Improving the &quot;Books&quot; page and adding similar ones for &quot;Movies&quot; and &quot;Games&quot;</li>
<li>Noting down some of my favorite recipes (will also try integrating <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/adding-cooklang-support-to-eleventy-two-ways/">cooklang</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who's next?</h2>
<p>Since I am more than half-a-year late to the bandwagon, I have little hope. But I would like to see the answers from <a href="https://notes.druchan.com">Chandru</a>, <a href="https://afsheen.me">Afsheen</a> and <a href="https://hamatti.org">Juhis</a> if they're interested.</p>
