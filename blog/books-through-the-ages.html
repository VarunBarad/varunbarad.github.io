                        <div class="post-content e-content"><p>This is my third listicle post in the media listicles I decided to publish during Blaugust 2025. You can check out the <a href="./games-through-the-ages">games</a> and <a href="./movies-through-the-ages">movies</a> posts first, or you can proceed to the list of books straight away.</p>
<h2>Grandma's Bag of Stories</h2>
<p>This is a collection of short stories told from the perspective of a grandma to her grandchildren. The stories are set in an Indian background, and each story gives a small moral lesson while being totally lighthearted themselves.</p>
<p>These stories are great light reading if read by yourself. But in my opinion, the best experience is had when someone reads them to you, or you read them to someone, whether it is to your kids, partner, or parents.</p>

<h2>Way of the Warrior Kid</h2>
<p>This one again is targeted towards kids, but I found it to be one of the most approachable self-help books. This keeps things basic and just gives you the big picture ideas of what you can do to feel and be better/healthier/however-you-wanna-say-it.</p>
<p>While most of you are not going to be Mark's age, I am pretty sure you can relate to his journey through his holidays with his Uncle Jake.</p>

<h2>Jurassic Park</h2>
<p>I would keep this short. Jurassic Park is one of my all-time favorite movies, and the only reason I did not include it in the <a href="./movies-through-the-ages">movies' post</a> is because I wanted to mention the book today.</p>
<p>It is amongst the top science fiction stories I have ever read. The movie is great, but it still falls short if compared to the book.</p>
<p>READ IT. READ IT NOW.</p>

<h2>Game Changer of Trauma Care</h2>
<p>This book is not commercially available, at least not that I know of. But it is the only book I have ever seen written on the role that an anaesthetist plays inside the hospital. The way I describe anaesthetists is: &quot;They keep you alive when someone is cutting you apart&quot;.</p>
<p>My wife is an anaesthetist herself, and I have seen first-hand how much mental stress they are constantly under. If you have a medical professional in your friends/family circle, then go and thank them today.</p>
<p>The closest book you can get to understand medical professionals' lives is: <a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL37813170M/This_is_going_to_hurt">This is going to hurt - by Adam Kay</a>.</p>
<h2>How To?</h2>
<p>We all would agree that cages hamper the growth of the captive. Similarly, thinking in regular real-world constraints also stunts our thinking from reaching absurd boundaries of what is actually possible.</p>
<p>Just to give an example: if you were told that you need to cross a river, would it occur to you that a possible way to do that could be to evaporate the complete river and then walk across the river-bed.</p>
<p>You can even pair it with the author's two other books: <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17095301W/What_If?mode=all">What If?</a> and <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17095301W/What_If?edition=key%3A/books/OL37018360M">What If? 2</a></p>

<h2>What? Where are the cover images?</h2>
<p>It is very late in the night here, and I cannot be bothered to add those covers right now.</p>
