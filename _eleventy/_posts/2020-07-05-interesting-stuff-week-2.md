Hi folks, this is the second edition of my new experiment where I list articles, podcasts, videos or basically anything I found interesting during last week.

1. [The Baboon That Controlled a Railway for 9 Years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpoLkMcQh24)
2. [Autofocusing reading glasses of the future - Nitish Padmanaban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y9ppMqXwkQ)
3. [Biohacking Lite](https://karpathy.github.io/2020/06/11/biohacking-lite/)
4. [Pitfalls in editing a bash script](https://thomask.sdf.org/blog/2019/11/09/take-care-editing-bash-scripts.html)

If you find something interesting and think I should check it out send it over to [interesting@varunbarad.com](mailto:interesting@varunbarad.com)
