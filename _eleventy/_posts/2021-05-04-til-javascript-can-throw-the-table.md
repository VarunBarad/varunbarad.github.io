Since JavaScript does not have the concept of a throwable type. Therefore you can throw anything in JavaScript.

```javascript
try {
  throw "the table";
  console.log("stable table")
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err);
}
```

The above code would produce `the table` in console logs and not `stable table`.
