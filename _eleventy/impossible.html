<p>
  I found out about the idea of an impossible list first from
  <a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/">Thomas Frank</a>. An impossible
  list is basically a challenge to yourself. It is a list of all things that I at one point of time thought I
  couldn't do simply because they were impossible (atleast for me). The challenge is to keep working towards these
  impossible things and chip away at them one bite at a time.

    <li>Write 500 words 100 days in a row</li>
    <li>Do a skydive</li>
