    This is a standing invitation: if we have common interests, I want to talk to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    My email address is <a href="mailto:{{contactDetails.email}}">{{contactDetails.email}}</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I love discussing stuff via email. Email works best for me and I prefer that over any social networks. I promise I'll read 100% of your emails and most probably reply to all of them.</li>
    <li>I love reading suggestions. If you see something on the internet worth discussing, send it over. Good content is priceless and I don't mind increasing my <a href="https://fs.blog/2013/06/the-antilibrary/">library of unread ideas</a>.</li>
    <li>I love making friends. If you are interested in talking, then let's have a chat sometime.</li>
  </ul>
