    <p>
        I found out about the idea of an impossible list first from <a
            href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/">Thomas Frank</a>. An impossible
        list is basically a challenge to yourself. It is a list of all things that I at one point of time thought I
        couldn't do simply because they were impossible (atleast for me). The challenge is to keep working towards these
        impossible things at chip away at them one bite at a time.

        <li>Perform 100 push-ups in a single set</li>
        <li>Summit a mountain</li>
        <li>Summit a snow-capped mountain</li>
        <li>Make a completely home-grown meal</li>
    </ul>
