<div class="page-title text-center text-uppercase col-12">Impossible List</div>
<div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-4 offset-sm-3 offset-lg-4 text-justify">
    <p>
        I found out about the idea of an impossible list first from <a
            href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/">Thomas Frank</a>. An impossible
        list is basically a challenge to yourself. It is a list of all things that I at one point of time thought I
        couldn't do simply because they were impossible (atleast for me). The challenge is to keep working towards these
        impossible things and chip away at them one bite at a time.
