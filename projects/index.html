      I like to use free time to create fun stuff or useful things, mainly for myself, but I share them too. They might
      not even have any practical purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      This page lists some of my projects, so you can get an idea of what I've been up to:

        <p>While there are a lot of websites available around to practice your typing, I wanted to build my own which is free of any ads or tracking.</p>
        
        <p>It's a simple website which gives you a random paragraph to type. The timer keeps going until you enter the whole paragraph correctly. At the end you are presented your typing speed in terms of words-per-minute.</p>

During college, we found it cumbersome to  track our attendance in various classes. That was the origin for this app. I made it so that there is a  streamlined way for students to keep track of their attendance.</p>

        <p>Worked a paid internship at Crawded which was an education startup focused on building a platform where students can interact with other students and teachers but the interaction remains related only to knowledge sharing. A vast number of features in the original SchoolWeb application were made by me, and I was responsible for developing the initial "Feed" in their main application.</p>

      <div class="project-description">
        
        <p>A stockbroking and wealth management firm required an application which helped them to provide up-to-date contact information of each of their offices and employees both to their employees and their customers. So I made a desktop application using Kotlin which would parse data provided by them in Excel files and upload it to Firebase, from where it would be pulled down by the Android application for their use.</p>
        
        <p>Sadly this project never reached finishing point and was thus never published.</p>

      <div class="project-description">
        
        <p>I got bored with seeing the same wallpaper and Gnome (the DE I was using) didn't have any inbuilt feature to cycle between wallpapers. So I decided to use this opportunity to try and dip my hands in Kotlin.</p>
        
        <p>Though these days I am thinking of building versions of this in Rust that work on Mac and Windows. No reason other than just to get more experience with Rust and to have fun.</p>
        
        <p>Months after that last statement, I have found out that atleast Mac has a built-in feature to cycle wallpapers. So hooray, I get more time to work on some other project.</p>

        <p>I made this project as part of my coursework for Udacity's Android Nanodegree. This taught me to use Gradle to create separate free and paid versions of an app, and including different features based on whether the app is free or paid. It also taught me how to separate an app into different modules for better code reuse.</p>
